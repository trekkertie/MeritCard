This is an app developed in Swift for the iOS, specifically for the iPad rather than the iPhone.

It is based on the paper merit cards used by schools to reward children for good work and behaviour. Each card is colour coded and there are twenty-five stamps per card. The user must achieve all twenty-five stamps on a card before moving to the next card. When a stamp is awarded the user taps a vacant merit on the card (represented by a circle with a plus sign inside). A pop-up shows the empty merit along with a space for a comment and the date issued. Simply tap the circle with the plus sign inside on the pop-up to allocate a merit. The allocated merit is shown as a circle with a tick inside. To exit the pop-up tap anywhere in the app outside of it.

Once the user has returned to the main card view the merit is shown as allocated together with the comment entered, if any, and the date issued.

The app requires iOS 18+.
